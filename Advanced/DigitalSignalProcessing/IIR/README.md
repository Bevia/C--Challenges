## Theory

adaptive IIR equalizer using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm implemented in modern C++. This example demonstrates how to adapt the coefficients of an IIR filter to equalize a signal distorted by a channel.

### AdaptiveIIRFilter Class:
        Constructor: Initializes filter parameters. order is the filter order, and mu is the adaptation step size.
        process() Function: Takes an input sample, processes it through the filter, and returns the output.
        adapt() Function: Updates the filter coefficients based on the LMS algorithm using the error signal.

###Â Main Function:
        Sets up the filter with specified order and step size.
        Defines simulated received_signal and reference_signal (in real applications, these would be your actual signals).
        Processes each sample of the received signal through the filter and adapts the filter coefficients based on the error between the desired and actual output.

## Note

This example is simplified for clarity. In real-world applications, you would need to handle additional complexities, such as:

    Initialization of coefficients.
    Handling edge cases and signal preprocessing.
    More sophisticated error handling and signal normalization.
    Performance optimizations for large data sets.

Feel free to adapt and extend this example to better suit your specific needs and application requirements.
