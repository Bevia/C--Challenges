Mutex

A mutex (short for "mutual exclusion") is a synchronization primitive that is used to prevent multiple threads from accessing a shared resource simultaneously. In other words, it ensures that only one thread can own the mutex and thus access the shared resource at a time. Mutexes help avoid race conditions where the outcome depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events.
