##Â Explanation for the atomicoperations.cpp code file

In the main function, two threads (t1 and t2) are created. Both threads execute the increment_counter function concurrently.
t1.join() and t2.join() ensure that the main function waits for both threads to finish their execution before proceeding.
Finally, the value of counter is printed to the console.

Atomic Variable: The variable counter is declared as std::atomic<int>, making all its operations atomic. This means operations on counter are performed without being interrupted by other threads, preventing data races.

Increment Function: The increment_counter function contains a loop that increments the counter variable 1000 times. The fetch_add method is used to perform the increment operation atomically.

Thread Creation: In the main function, two threads (t1 and t2) are created, both of which run the increment_counter function simultaneously.

Thread Joining: The join method is called on both threads to ensure that the main thread waits for the completion of t1 and t2 before proceeding. This ensures that the program does not print the final value of counter until both threads have completed their execution.

Final Output: After both threads have finished executing, the final value of counter is printed. Since each thread increments the counter by 1000, the expected output is 2000.

### Key Points

Thread Safety: Using std::atomic ensures that the increment operations are thread-safe, preventing race conditions where multiple threads might interfere with each other.

Concurrency: The use of multiple threads (t1 and t2) demonstrates how concurrent execution can be managed safely using atomic operations.
Deterministic Output: Because of the atomic nature of counter, the final value printed is deterministic (2000), even though the threads run concurrently. Without atomic operations, the final value might be unpredictable due to race conditions.

This example illustrates how atomic operations can be used to safely update shared data from multiple threads, ensuring correctness and avoiding race conditions.
