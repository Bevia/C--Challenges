### Run wit C++11, use the following command:
    g++ -std=c++11 ./MemoryManagement/Fragmentation/fragmentation.cpp -o ./MemoryManagement/Fragmentation/fragmentation.cpp -o fragmentation

#### To run the program, use this command:
    ./fragmentation

## Theory

In memory management, fragmentation can occur when free memory is broken into small, non-contiguous blocks over time, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous memory blocks even if the total free memory is sufficient.
