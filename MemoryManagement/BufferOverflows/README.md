A buffer overflow occurs when data exceeds the boundaries of a buffer, allowing it to overwrite adjacent memory. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Despite improvements in modern C++ and compiler checks, buffer overflows can still occur if not carefully handled.
